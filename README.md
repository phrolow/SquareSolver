This console application solves any equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c. At the beginning it asks to input coefficients a, b, c, then it prints solution of equation. It also considers the linear case: so, if you input a == 0, it will solve equation of the form bx + c = 0. If you input wrong data, it will ask you to input again. To finish application you must close it, otherwise you will forever solve quadratic equations( It also contains test mode.
